# Azure Packer Images

Azure Packer Image Build Project

## Getting Started

Each folder contains its own `json` file with the packer build manifest. Install `packer` and run `packer build` or use the Azure DevOps pipelines to create your VM image in azure.

Further details on each image can be found in a `readme.md` in each folder.
